    <h2>Summary:</h2>
    <p>
      I am web developer with in-depth experience in UI/UX design. In a
      nutshell, I create websites that help organizations address business
      challenges and meet their needs. I manage everything from website
      navigation and layout to a company’s web hosting and security
      architecture. My expertise lies within front-end web apps, and the main
      languages in my tech stack are JavaScript, React, and of course HTML/CSS.
      I’m a lifelong learner and love to read, run and play chess.</p><hr>
